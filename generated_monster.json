A wizard specializing in culinary magic attempted to create the ultimate dessert and accidentally infused a dragon egg with magical caramel. The result was Karamell, a unique dragon with abilities related to caramel. Despite its origins, Karamell quickly became more than just a magical experiment, forming a deep bond with the wizard who raised it as a pet and guardian."
