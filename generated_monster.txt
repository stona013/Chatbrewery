### Special Abilities:
**Multiple Heads:** The Gloomfang Hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.

**Regeneration:** The Gloomfang Hydra regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the hydra takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the hydra's next turn. The hydra dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Wake of Gloom:** At the start of each of the hydra's turns, it emits a chilling, dark mist in a 10-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn in the mist must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions:
**Multiattack:** The hydra makes as many bite attacks as it has heads.

**Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage.

**Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The hydra exhales acid in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions:
The Gloomfang Hydra can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The hydra regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect:** The hydra makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Swipe:** The hydra makes one tail attack.

**Head Regrowth (Costs 2 Actions):** If the hydra has fewer than five heads and hasn’t taken fire damage since its last turn, it regrows one severed head and regains 10 hit points.

### Description:
The Gloomfang Hydra is a terrifying amalgamation of darkness and reptilian ferocity. Born in the deepest, coldest parts of the world's oceans, it adapted to the darkness, its body exuding a chilling mist that saps the warmth from all who dare approach it. It is feared by sailors and coastal settlements, as it sometimes emerges from the depths to hunt under the cover of foggy nights. Its multiple heads snap ferociously at any prey within reach, while its thick scales repel lesser weapons with ease.
