### Abilities:

**Celestial Camouflage:** While in dim light or darkness, the Starweaver Drake can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Innate Spellcasting:** The Starweaver Drake's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
- At will: *light, dancing lights, minor illusion*
- 3/day each: *misty step, scrying*
- 1/day: *teleport, reverse gravity*

**Starfire Breath (Recharge 5â€“6):** The Starweaver Drake exhales radiant fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Twilight Shroud:** As a bonus action, the Starweaver Drake can create a shroud of twinkling starlight in a 30-foot radius around itself. The area is lightly obscured, and each hostile creature that starts its turn in the shroud must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the shroud ends. The shroud lasts for 1 minute or until dispelled. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Actions:

**Multiattack:** The Starweaver Drake makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

**Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.

### Legendary Actions:
The Starweaver Drake can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Starweaver Drake regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- **Detect:** The Starweaver Drake makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The Starweaver Drake beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the Drake must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The drake can then fly up to half its flying speed.
- **Healing Starlight (Costs 3 Actions):** The Starweaver Drake harnesses the celestial energy around it to heal itself for 50 hit points.

### Environment:
