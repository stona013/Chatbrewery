**Lore:**
Born from the union of a cloud giant and a storm elemental, the Skyrift Behemoth roams the highest peaks and the deepest valleys of the world. Its massive form is often cloaked in storm clouds, and it is said that thunderstorms follow wherever it treads. The Skyrift Behemoth is a solitary creature, preferring the isolation of high altitudes and rarely descending to lower lands unless provoked or during its rare mating seasons. Its elemental nature grants it control over thunder and cold, making it a formidable opponent in combat. Despite its fearsome appearance and abilities, the Skyrift Behemoth possesses a complex intelligence and occasionally communicates with those brave enough to approach it peacefully.
