### Lore

The Test, a fearsome variant of giants known for their control over earth and stone, often serve as elite guardians or warlords in giant societies. Their bodies are as tough as the rocks they manipulate, and their innate connection to the earth grants them abilities that terrify those who dare invade their territories. These giants are typically solitary, aligning with others only to defend their lands or to wage war under a powerful leader. Their name, a term from the ancient Giant tongue, signifies their role as the ultimate challenge or "test" for any would-be conqueror or adversary.
