### Lore:
Voralis, the Eclipse Serpent, is a creature of ancient darkness, born from the shadow of a fallen celestial during a lunar eclipse. It haunts the darkest corners of the world, spreading fear and corruption. Its lair is typically found in deep caverns or abandoned temples where darkness can thrive. Voralis is often worshipped by cults and dark sorcerers who seek to harness its power of shadows and necromancy for their own nefarious purposes. Its arrival is often heralded by an unnatural eclipse, under which it moves freely, cloaked in darkness.
